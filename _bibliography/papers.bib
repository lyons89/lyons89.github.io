abstract = {© 2017 Longmate et al. Development of wound therapies is hindered by poor understanding of combinatorial integrin function in the epidermis. In this study, we generated mice with epidermis-specific deletion of α3β1, α9β1, or both integrins as well as keratinocyte lines expressing these integrin combinations. Consistent with proangiogenic roles for α3β1, α3-null keratinocytes showed reduced paracrine stimulation of endothelial cell migration and survival, and wounds of epidermis-specific α3 knockout mice displayed impaired angiogenesis. Interestingly, α9β1 in keratinocytes suppressed α3β1-mediated stimulation of endothelial cells, and wounds of epidermis-specific α9 knockout mice displayed delayed vascular normalization and reduced endothelial apoptosis, indicating that α9β1 cross-suppresses α3β1 proangiogenic functions. Moreover, α9β1 inhibited α3β1 signaling downstream of focal adhesion kinase ({FAK}) autoactivation at the point of Src-mediated phosphorylation of {FAK} Y861/Y925. Finally, α9β1 cross-suppressed many α3β1-dependent genes, including the gene that encodes {MMP}-9, which we implicated as a regulator of integrin-dependent cross talk to endothelial cells. Our findings identify a novel physiological context for combinatorial integrin signaling, laying the foundation for therapeutic strategies that manipulate α9β1 and/or α3β1 during wound healing.},

abstract = {It is unknown how cues from the tumor microenvironment can regulate post-transcriptional mechanisms, such as alternative splicing, that control genes that drive malignant growth. The induction of cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) by integrin α3β1 in breast cancer cells can promote tumor progression. We have used {RNAi} to suppress α3β1 in human {MDA}-{MB}-231 breast cancer cells and then investigated changes in global gene expression. Numerous {mRNAs}, including Cox-2, show altered expression and/or alternative exon usage ({AEU}) in α3β1-deficient cells. {AEU} included patterns predicted to render an {mRNA} susceptible to degradation, such as 39-{UTR} variations or retention of elements that target an {mRNA} for nonsense-mediated decay ({NMD}). {PCR}-based analysis of α3β1-deficient cells confirmed changes in Cox-2 {mRNA} that might target it for {NMD}, including retention of an intron that harbors premature termination codons and changes within the 3'- {UTR}. Moreover, Cox-2 {mRNA} has reduced stability in α3β1- deficient cells, which is partially reversed by knockdown of the essential {NMD} factor {UPF}1. Our study identifies α3β1-mediated {AEU} as a novel paradigm of integrin-dependent gene regulation that has potential for exploitation as a therapeutic target. © 2014.

abstract = {Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is an essential protein kinase that promotes faithful mitotic progression in eukaryotes. The subcellular localization and substrate interactions of Plk1 are tightly controlled and require its binding to phosphorylated residues. To identify phosphorylation-dependent interactions within the Plk1 network in human mitotic cells, we performed quantitative proteomics on {HeLa} cells cultured with kinase inhibitors or expressing a Plk1 mutant that was deficient in phosphorylation-dependent substrate binding. We found that many interactions were abolished upon kinase inhibition; however, a subset was protected from phosphatase opposition or was unopposed, resulting in persistent interaction of the substrate with Plk1. This subset includes phosphoprotein phosphatase 6 ({PP}6), whose activity toward Aurora kinase A (Aurora A) was inhibited by Plk1. Our data suggest that this Plk1-{PP}6 interaction generates a feedback loop that coordinates and reinforces the activities of Plk1 and Aurora A during mitotic entry and is terminated by the degradation of Plk1 during mitotic exit. Thus, we have identified a mechanism for the previously puzzling observation of the Plk1-dependent regulation of Aurora A.},

abstract = {A “tug-of-war” between kinases and phosphatases establishes the phosphorylation states of proteins. While serine and threonine phosphorylation can be catalyzed by more than 400 protein kinases, the majority of serine and threonine dephosphorylation is carried out by seven phosphoprotein phosphatases ({PPPs}). The {PPP} family consists of protein phosphatases 1 ({PP}1), 2A ({PP}2A), 2B ({PP}2B), 4 ({PP}4), 5 ({PP}5), 6 ({PP}6), and 7 ({PP}7). The imbalance in numbers between serine- and threonine-directed kinases and phosphatases led to the early belief that {PPPs} are unspecific and that kinases are the primary determinants of protein phosphorylation. However, it is now clear that {PPPs} achieve specificity through association with noncatalytic subunits to form multimeric holoenzymes, which expands the number of functionally distinct signaling entities to several hundred. Although there has been great progress in deciphering signaling by kinases, much less is known about phosphatases. We have developed a chemical proteomic strategy for the systematic interrogation of endogenous {PPP} catalytic subunits and their interacting proteins, including regulatory and scaffolding subunits (the “{PPPome}”). {PP}1, {PP}2A, {PP}4, {PP}5, and {PP}6 were captured using an immobilized, specific but nonselective {PPP} inhibitor microcystin-{LR} ({MCLR}), followed by protein identification by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry ({LC}-{MS}/{MS}) in a single analysis. Here, we combine this approach of phosphatase inhibitor bead profiling and mass spectrometry ({PIB}-{MS}) with label-free and tandem mass tag ({TMT}) quantification to map the {PPPome} in human cancer cell lines, mouse tissues, and yeast species, through which we identify cell- and tissue-type-specific {PPP} expression patterns and discover new {PPP} interacting proteins.},

abstract = {Objective
Stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) is a single-pass transmembrane endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum (E/SR) protein recognized for its role in a store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE), an ancient and ubiquitous signaling pathway. Whereas STIM1 is known to be indispensable during development, its biological and metabolic functions in mature muscles remain unclear.
Methods
Conditional and tamoxifen inducible muscle STIM1 knock-out mouse models were coupled with multi-omics tools and comprehensive physiology to understand the role of STIM1 in regulating SOCE, mitochondrial quality and bioenergetics, and whole-body energy homeostasis.
Results
This study shows that STIM1 is abundant in adult skeletal muscle, upregulated by exercise, and is present at SR-mitochondria interfaces. Inducible tissue-specific deletion of STIM1 (iSTIM1 KO) in adult muscle led to diminished lean mass, reduced exercise capacity, and perturbed fuel selection in the settings of energetic stress, without affecting whole-body glucose tolerance. Proteomics and phospho-proteomics analyses of iSTIM1 KO muscles revealed molecular signatures of low-grade E/SR stress and broad activation of processes and signaling networks involved in proteostasis.
Conclusion
These results show that STIM1 regulates cellular and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics, energy metabolism and proteostasis in adult skeletal muscles. Furthermore, these findings provide insight into the pathophysiology of muscle diseases linked to disturbances in STIM1-dependent Ca2+ handling.}

For {PP}2A, {PP}4, and {PP}6, holoenzyme formation is in part regulated by carboxyl (C)-terminal methyl-esterification (often referred to as “methylation”). Here, we use mass spectrometry-based proteomics, methylation-ablating mutations, and genome editing to elucidate the role of C-terminal methylation on {PP}2A, {PP}4, and {PP}6 holoenzyme assembly. We find that the catalytic subunits of {PP}2A, {PP}4, and {PP}6 are frequently methylated in cancer cells and that deletion of the C-terminal leucine faithfully recapitulates loss of methylation. We observe that loss of {PP}2A methylation consistently reduced B55, B56, and B72 regulatory subunit binding in cancer and non-transformed cell lines. However, Striatin subunit binding is only affected in non-transformed cells. For {PP}4, we find that {PP}4R1 and {PP}4R3β bind in a methylation-dependent manner. Intriguingly, loss of methylation does not affect {PP}6 holoenzymes. Our analyses demonstrate in an unbiased, comprehensive, and isoform-specific manner the crucial regulatory function of endogenous {PPP} methylation in transformed and non-transformed cell lines.},

Glycogen synthesis and breakdown are tightly controlled by glycogen synthase ({GYS}) and phosphorylase, respectively. The enzyme responsible for dephosphorylating {GYS} and phosphorylase, which results in their activation ({GYS}) or inactivation (phosphorylase) to robustly stimulate glycogen synthesis, is protein phosphatase 1 ({PP}1). However, our understanding of how {PP}1 recruits these substrates is limited. Here, we show how {PP}1, together with its muscle glycogen-targeting ({GM}) regulatory subunit, recruits and selectively dephosphorylates its substrates. Our molecular data reveal that the {GM} carbohydrate binding module ({GMCBM}21), which is amino-terminal to the {GM} {PP}1 binding domain, has a dual function in directing {PP}1 substrate specificity: It either directly recruits substrates (i.e., {GYS}) or recruits them indirectly by localization (via glycogen for phosphorylase). Our data provide the molecular basis for {PP}1 regulation by {GM} and reveal how {PP}1-mediated dephosphorylation is driven by scaffolding-based substrate recruitment.},

abstract = {© 2017 The Authors Proteolytic processing of the laminin-γ2 chain is a hallmark of basement membrane maturation in the skin. Integrin α3β1, a major receptor for epidermal adhesion to laminin-332, is critical for proper basement membrane organization during skin development and wound healing. Previously, we identified a role for α3β1 in promoting the processing of laminin-γ2 in cultured keratinocytes in vitro and in wound epidermis in vivo. In this study we identify the Bmp1 gene, which encodes variants of the {mTLD}/{BMP}-1 metalloproteases, as a critical regulator of α3β1-dependent laminin-γ2 processing, thereby expanding the role of this integrin in controlling the secretion by the epidermis of factors that modulate the tissue microenvironment. Because our previous studies identified another epidermal integrin, α9β1, as a suppressive regulator of α3β1-dependent wound angiogenesis, we investigated whether α9β1 has a similar cross-suppressive effect on the ability of α3β1 to promote basement membrane organization. Here, we show that, rather than a cross-suppressive role, α9β1 has an opposing role in basement membrane assembly/maturation through reduced laminin-γ2 processing via {mTLD}/{BMP}-1. Although α3β1 promotes this process during wound healing, α9β1 has an inhibitory role, suggesting that regulation of basement membrane assembly requires a complex interplay between these distinct epidermal integrins.},

Normally highly expressed in skeletal muscle, STIM1 deficiency causes significant changes to mitochondrial ultrastructure that do not occur with loss of ORAI1 or other components of SOCE. The datasets in this article are from large-scale proteomics and phosphoproteomics experiments in an inducible mouse model of skeletal muscle-specific STIM1 knock out (KO). These data reveal statistically significant changes in the relative abundance of specific proteins and sites of protein phosphorylation in STIM1 KO gastrocnemius. Protein samples from five biological replicates of each condition (+/- STIM1) were enzymatically digested, the resulting peptides labeled with tandem mass tag (TMT) reagents, mixed, and fractionated. Phosphopeptides were enriched and a small amount of each input retained for protein abundance analysis. All phosphopeptide and input fractions were analyzed by nano LC-MS/MS on a Q Exactive Plus Orbitrap mass spectrometer, searched with Proteome Discoverer software, and processed with in-house R-scripts for data normalization and statistical analysis.
