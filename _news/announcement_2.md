Announcements and news can be much longer than just quick inline posts. In fact, they can have all the features available for the standard blog posts. See below.

Using github pages for a personal website seems pretty nice so far. A little more leg work than just making my own website, but I'd also have to pay money to have it hosted while githhub pages is free. My plan is to slowly fill in these different pages from the al-folio template that I'm using. Can add bibliography, CV, github repositories.  

One of the first things I want to do is fill in a resources section, from learning R or python to which packages to use for differnt steps in the proteomics data analysis pathway.
