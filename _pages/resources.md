Learning "R"

Once you learn the basics, I would recommend focusing on learning the tidyverse packages first, with dplyr and ggplot2 being the most useful, then tidyr, purrr, stringr, and forcats.

Posit, formally Rstudio, has a bunch of (cheatsheets)[https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/] for their many amamzing and useful packages

(swirl)[https://swirlstats.com/] - first tool I used to learn R. Easy to set up and get started with.

Another really great resource is (bookdown)[https://bookdown.org/]. It has easy to read ebooks with code, including the very famous "R for data science" by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. If you look through all the books you will find topics ranging from genomics analysis to biostats and more.

Another resource that I used during COVID was (datacamp)[https://www.datacamp.com/]. They give you a few very basic courses in R and python for free but you'll have to pay to access everything. With a univeristy email I think I paid under $200 for a year subscription. Back in grad school that was a shit ton of money to me, but being able to practice what I was being told helped me retain the information a lot better.
