My name is Scott Lyons, I have a Ph.D in proteomics. After I started a postdoc and got more into proteomics bioinformatics. I've had an itch recently after spending the last two years closely watching Ben Orsburn [proteomics news](https://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/) blog.

I somehow managed to learn R in graduate school and continued to perfect my coding skills during my postdoc. I've spent a lot of my time looking for ways to make my proteomics data analysis faster, more efficient, and reproducible and I hope to use his github pages website as a resource for myself and others who follow in my path.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
