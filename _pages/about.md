My name is Scott Lyons, I have a Ph.D in proteomics. After I started a postdoc and got more into proteomics bioinformatics. I've had an itch recently after spending the last two years closely watching Ben Orsburn [proteomics news](https://proteomicsnews.blogspot.com/) blog. I recommend you join the [proteomics subreddit](reddit.com/r/proteomics), like 900+ fellow proteomics enthusiasts who are always happy to answer questions.

I somehow managed to learn R in graduate school by googling each line of code, one at a time, and gained more experience coding during my postdoc. I've spent a lot of my time looking for ways to make my proteomics data analysis faster, more efficient, and reproducible and I hope to use this github pages blog as a resource for myself and others who follow in my path.
