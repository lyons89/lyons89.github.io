One of the most common questions I hear and see in bioinformatics is which programming language should i learn, R or python? This question is always all over the web. I'm obviously a little biased since I really started with R (not counting a python course I took in undergrad). Everyone says python is easier to learn, but I disagree, I thought R was very straight forward and easy to learn. Additionally, I think R is better suited for the academic setting where you would want the most cutting edge packages available, and you're not trying to develop any type of long integrate pipeline. Python would be better in an indrustry setting when you've got a pipeline and the main goal is to push out data as fast as possible. I would love to have a reason to pick up and start using python, but right now the majoirty of my post processing data analysis revolves around the MSstats family of packages.
You may have recently heard that the company Rstudio changed its name to posit, trying to spread out and away from just R I think. I hope they add more to the python community.
